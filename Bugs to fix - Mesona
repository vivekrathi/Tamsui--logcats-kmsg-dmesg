1) Audio: Doesn't work with legacy too...
- Audio panel slutters while pressing volume keys...
- DSPManager Crashes...

2) Adb [Maybe mounting issue]: Cannot post output, "System is Read-only"

3) SDCard is Read-only, can't write anything on it... [Used fstab from JLO device tree]

4) Build is userdebug, though it doesn't allow to debug while booting...
